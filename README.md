### Hi there 👋🏿

My name is Brandon Piquant and I am a software engineer with a focus primarily on front-end developing. I enjoy coding because it allows me to express myself in unique and creative ways.

I am fortunate to have experience with UI and photoshop which gives me a creative edge in my approach. I take pride in my ability to empathize with people becuase I am able to understand exactly what they are looking for. It also makes me a pro with team-building and collaborations.

Other interests of mine outside of coding are traveling, excercising, playing sports, and playing video games (although not much time these days 😕)
I am a husband and a father and love nothing more than spending time with family. I was raised in the Bahamas for the first part of my life before moving to the US. I also have Haitian lineage as well.

My ideal job would be one with a passionate team of diverse indiviuals that all work together cohesively to deliver exemplary results while enjoying the process. I love what I do and enjoy working with others that do too. I also appreciate teams that mentor one another and lift each other up. We can all learn something from one another no matter how far along we are in our respective journeys.
